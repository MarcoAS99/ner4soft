Note that the `tippecanoe`\nobject belongs to the Feature, not to its `properties`. If you specify a `minzoom` for a feature,\nit will be preserved down to that zoom level even if dot-dropping with `-r` would otherwise have\ndropped it.\n\nYou can also specify a layer name in the `tippecanoe` object, which will take precedence over\nthe filename or name specified using `--layer`, like this:\n\nCODE_BLOCK\n\nIf your source GeoJSON only has `minzoom`, `maxzoom` and/or `layer` within `properties` you can use [ndjson-cli](https://github.com/mbostock/ndjson-cli/blob/master/README.md) to move them into the required `tippecanoe` object by piping the GeoJSON like this:\n\nCODE_BLOCK\n\nGeometric simplifications\n-------------------------\n\nAt every zoom level, line and polygon features are subjected to Douglas-Peucker\nsimplification to the resolution of the tile.\n\nFor point features, it drops 1/2.5 of the dots for each zoom level above the\npoint base zoom (which is normally the same as the `-z` max zoom, but can be\na different zoom specified with `-B` if you have precise but sparse data).\nI don't know why 2.5 is the appropriate number, but the densities of many different\ndata sets fall off at about this same rate. You can use -r to specify a different rate.\n\nYou can use the gamma option to thin out especially dense clusters of points.\nFor any area where dots are closer than one pixel together (at whatever zoom level),\na gamma of 3, for example, will reduce these clusters to the cube root of their original density.\n\nFor line features, it drops any features that are too small to draw at all.\nThis still leaves the lower zooms too dark (and too dense for the 500K tile limit,\nin some places), so I need to figure out an equitable way to throw features away.\n\nUnless you specify `--no-tiny-polygon-reduction`,\nany polygons that are smaller than a minimum area (currently 4 square subpixels) will\nhave their probability diffused, so that some of them will be drawn as a square of\nthis minimum size and others will not be drawn at all, preserving the total area that\nall of them should have had together.\n\nFeatures in the same tile that share the same type and attributes are coalesced\ntogether into a single geometry if you use `--coalesce`. You are strongly encouraged to use -x to exclude\nany unnecessary attributes to reduce wasted file size.\n\nIf a tile is larger than 500K, it will try encoding that tile at progressively\nlower resolutions before failing if it still doesn't fit.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nRequires sqlite3 and zlib (should already be installed on MacOS). Rebuilding the manpage\nuses md2man (`gem install md2man`).\n\nLinux:\n\n    sudo apt-get install build-essential libsqlite3-dev zlib1g-dev\n\nThen build:\n\n    make\n\nand perhaps\n\n    make install\n\nTippecanoe now requires features from the 2011 C++ standard. If your compiler is older than\nthat, you will need to install a newer one. On MacOS, updating to the lastest XCode should\nget you a new enough version of `clang++`.
