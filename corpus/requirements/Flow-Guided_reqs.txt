## Requirements: Software

1. MXNet from [the offical repository](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet). We tested our code on [MXNet@(v0.10.0)](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/v0.10.0). Due to the rapid development of MXNet, it is recommended to checkout this version if you encounter any issues. We may maintain this repository periodically if MXNet adds important feature in future release.

2. Python packages might missing: cython, opencv-python >= 3.2.0, easydict. If `pip` is set up on your system, those packages should be able to be fetched and installed by running
	```
	pip install Cython
	pip install opencv-python==3.2.0.6
	pip install easydict==1.6
	```
3. For Windows users, Visual Studio 2015 is needed to compile cython module.


## Requirements: Hardware

Any NVIDIA GPUs with at least 8GB memory should be OK.
