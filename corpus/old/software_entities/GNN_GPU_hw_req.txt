You must have a compatible NVIDIA GPU for the GPU acceleration to work, however this work consists of performance improvements-for the standard GNN-that can speed up the CPU training as well. The
scope of this repo is limited to the use of GNN and GPUs though.


There is an AWS AMI that was created that you can use (ami-077ae915aa4f576fe), or you can generate your own with [this](https://github.com/xwang2713/cloud-image-build).
This produces an image with HPCC Systems Platform Community edition, version 7.10.00 pre-installed as well as all other requirements for this bundle, including CUDA version 10.0.
The image is designed to run on Amazon's [P2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p2/) or [P3](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p3/) machines.
