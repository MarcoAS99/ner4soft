Pytorch implementation for high-resolution (e.g., 2048x1024) photorealistic video-to-video translation. It can be used for turning semantic label maps into photo-realistic videos, synthesizing people talking from edge maps, or generating human motions from poses. The core of video-to-video translation is image-to-image translation. Some of our work in that space can be found in [pix2pixHD](https://github.com/NVIDIA/pix2pixHD) and [SPADE](https://github.com/NVlabs/SPADE). <br><br>
