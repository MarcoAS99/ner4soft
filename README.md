# ner4soft
Repository for experiments and corpora for named entity recognition (NER) for software repositories, code  and readme files.

This repository contains a software-centric NER approach based (initially) in rules and gazetteers. The idea is to use this system from other applications to obtain better context of software documentation. 

Initial experiments:
- Dependencies (package, version, higher than/lower than qualifiers)
- Qualiiers on installation instructions (e.g., platform (Docker, Conda, etc.), OS (Unix, Windows, etc.), and others)
- Persons (citations)
- Conferences (citations)
- Frameworks (e.g., Keras, Tensorflow)
- Dataset formats
